Official Bitly plugin for WordPress. Replaces shared links with Bitly short URLs.  Also, gives you the option of placing a Bitly widget on your site. Built and powered by Bitly.

== Description ==

With our new WordPress plug-in you can automatically create Bitly links for new posts and have those short links pushed to your pre-existing social sharing tools.  Additionally, you can show a Bitly sidebar widget that displays your most popular or most recent bitmarks OR displays the top results from the bitly universe for a search term of your choosing.  

This plugin uses the Bitly API (http://dev.bitly.com) all links are stored in WordPress and with Bitly.

== Installation ==

1. Install the plugin either via the WordPress.org plugin directory, or by uploading the files to your server.
2. After activating the plugin, you will need to visit the plugin's settings page to finish the setup for link shortening.
3. If you want to use the sidebar widget, you should see a 'Bitly Bitmarks' under your Available Widgets  (under your WP Appearance settings) which you can drag into the main sidebar
4. That's it. You're ready to go!

= How does the plugin handle previously created posts? =

Posts that were created prior to installing the plugin will only get a bitly short link when someone actually visits the old post.  This will result in old posts showing up in your public bitly bitmark stream (https://bitly.com/u/BITLYUSERNAME) unless you have set your default bitmark privacy settings to "Private" at https://bitly.com/a/settings/saving
